# Monumento Standalone

Monumento Standalone is a standalone Flutter application that has been created by extracting and adapting a Flutter module from the existing [Monumento Android app](https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Monumento). It functions independently as its own mobile application, separate from the original Android app.
